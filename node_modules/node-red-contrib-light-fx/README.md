Lighting effect extensions for [node-red-contrib-light]().

The primary reason this node set was created was to easily control any automated lights using the Hue Dimmer Light Switch.


# How it works

Pick the effect node you want, configure it, and wire it up to a node-red-config-light Updates node.
